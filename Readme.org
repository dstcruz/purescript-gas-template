* Purescript-GAS-Template 

A template project to get you jump-started using [[https://developers.google.com/apps-script][Google Apps Script]] with [[https://www.purescript.org][Purescript]].

See ~src/App/Sample.purs~ for the simplest of interactions. Once you build and
publish this code to your spreadsheet (see Publish below), you will be able to:

 - In a cell, put the formula ~=HELLO("world")~ to see "Hello wold" returned by your purescript code.

 - See a new menu called "FromPurescript", with 2 entries which make a toast appear with a message.

** Environment

 If you have nix, see the overlay at ~purescript.nix~ for easy purescript
 development tools.

 Once you have that, it is easy to jump into an environment to work on this
 codebase with:

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
 nix-shell -p purs-0_13_3 spago nodejs-10_x yarn
 #+END_SRC

** Init

 To init, follow standand npm/yarn procedure:

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
 yarn install
 #+END_SRC

** Build

 See ~package.json~ for build, rebuild, clean, publish scripts.

** Publish

 This package uses [[https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp][google's clasp]] to upload the script to google servers. You will
 need to first login in order to be able to execute the ~clasp push~ command run by
 the ~publish~ script. Login in is as simple as 

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell
 npx clasp login
 #+END_SRC

 You will also need to create a Spreadsheet, open "Tools > Script Editor", name
 the script, and capture the ~scriptId~ from the Script Editor's "View > Project properties"
 menu. Insert that value into ~.clasp.json~.

** Building notes

 As a first step, we build the purescript code with ~spago~. Once that is done,
 we call ~webpack~ to bundle things up with our ~index.js~ file as the entry
 point. Since google doesn't understand plain, modern, javascript, ~webpack~
 transpiles (via ~babel~), and then uses the [[https://github.com/fossamagna/gas-webpack-plugin][gas-webpack-plugin]] to massage
 the javascript into code that google's app engine likes. ~GAS~ expects that all declarations be top-level,
 so this plugin detects expressions assigned to ~global~ and generates a top-level declaration for it.
